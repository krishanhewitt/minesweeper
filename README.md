## Minesweeper clone
This was one of the bigger projects from my 2nd Java programming course. The goal was to create a replica of the classic minesweeper game using Java and JavaFX (a GUI library).

## Screenshots
Pictures can be found on my [Project Website](http://krishanhewitt.ca/projectPage.php#msDiv).

## Tech/Libraries used
  -Java8  
  -JavaFX  
  -EclipseIDE  
  
## Features
   Has all the original features of Minesweeper such as:  
   -First click is *always* a spot with no mines  
   -Empty tiles adjacent to other empty tiles reveal themselves when clicked  
   -Boards are randomly generated and numbers are correctly calculated  
   -etc.  
    
## Skills worked on
  -Keeping classes seperate to promote high cohesion/low coupling  
  -Practiced commenting methods/variables to save time when coming back to this code after not seeing it for a while  
 
## Installation
Compilation and running of this program requires Java8 and the JavaFX plugin installed (e(fx)clipse).
